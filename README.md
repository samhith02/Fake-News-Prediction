The code segment is part of a program designed for fake news prediction using machine learning and natural language processing techniques. It begins by importing essential libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, NLTK, and scikit-learn for data manipulation, text preprocessing, and model building. The code downloads NLTK's stopwords corpus and prints out the list of stopwords, which will be used to filter out common words during text preprocessing. Next, it loads a dataset, presumably containing news articles, into a Pandas dataframe, checks its dimensions, and displays the first few rows to inspect the data structure. This process sets the stage for data preprocessing tasks like removing stopwords, applying stemming, and converting text into numerical features using TF-IDF vectorization, ultimately enabling the construction and evaluation of a predictive model, such as logistic regression, to classify news articles as fake or genuine based on their textual content.
